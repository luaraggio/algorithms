<p>
  Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It follows the "divide and conquer" principle, reducing the search space by half at each step:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compares the target element with the middle element of the list.</li>
  <li>If equal, the search is successfully completed.</li>
  <li>If smaller, the search continues in the left half of the list.</li>
  <li>If greater, the search continues in the right half.</li>
  <li>The process repeats until the element is found or the search space is exhausted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Use Binary Search?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Binary Search has a time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>, making it significantly faster than linear search <code>O(n)</code> for large lists.</li>
  <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> The list must be sorted for the algorithm to function correctly.</li>
</ul>
